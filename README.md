# tic-tac

# Abstract
 **For my final solo project titled tic-tac-toe i created a full finctional tic tac toe game themed around my favorite movie Scott Pilgrim Vs the World**

# Challenges

**For this project i would say i faced two very big challenges, the first being that i learned that my variables should not have any coorelations to others, when i was trying to make my statements for what happens if the game is a draw i titled my queryselected draw variable as draw, i alsohad a this.draw in my game file, because of this whenever i called forth draw in my logic file it wouldnt read the right one. This taught me that javascript is smart but it is also literal an i should be as specific as possible. The next big challenge i faced was reading the Spec sheet and seeing i needed a game class. The first two days i did all the work solely in my player file as well as my logic file to find out that i did it wrong, so i had to redo my code in order to put it within the game class, the biggest thing that helped me here was realizing if i treat the game class as the rules of the game and the logic file as the presentation!**

# Wins

**My biggest win for this project had to either be feeling 100% confident with HTML and CSS or the fact that towards the end i felt immensely confident in my ability to understand how class to class interactions work!**
